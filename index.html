                <p class="history-desk">
                    Camping, dating back to the 19th century, has evolved into a beloved outdoor activity. Initially an
                    escape from urbanization, it gained popularity through pioneers like Thomas Hiram Holding and
                    organizations like the Boy Scouts. Innovations in camping gear in the mid-20th century further
                    fueled its appeal. Today, camping offers diverse experiences, allowing individuals and families to
                    disconnect, embrace nature, and build a sense of community. Its enduring charm lies in providing a
                    break from modern life while fostering an appreciation for the outdoors and environmental
                    stewardship.

                                conditions.

                                Easy to fold is one of the main features of our chairs. With an innovative folding
                                design, the chair can be folded into a smaller size and is easy to carry when traveling.
                                This makes it easy for you to store it in the car, take it to the park, beach, picnic or
